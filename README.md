 SFML Game Framework w/premake

to generate project files on windows with VS2022 simply run the Generate project.bat and open the sln

if on other IDEs open the bat and change to the appropriate premake run arg although MSVC is assumed so other compilers may fail to build

other platforms are not currently supported as changes to the premake file will need to be made.
